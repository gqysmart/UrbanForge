# UrbanForge 🏙️🔥

UrbanForge is an AI-powered urban design and development optimization tool. It helps users generate conceptual land planning and building designs based on different development goals such as **maximum property valuation**, **highest investment return**, or **optimal cash flow**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Goal-driven Design Generator**  
  Generate land use and building concepts based on strategic development goals.

- 📐 **Smart Zoning & Massing Proposals**  
  Automatically calculate buildable area, layout schemes, height, and volume.

- 💰 **Financial Feasibility Calculator**  
  Evaluate ROI, NPV, cash flow, and cost-benefit based on design output.

- 📊 **Visual Feedback**  
  View designs in 2D/3D with instant feedback on financial performance.

- 🧱 **Expandable Architecture**  
  Built with a modular tech stack for future integration with AI generative models (e.g., ControlNet, LoRA), GIS data, or BIM tools.

## 🧭 Strategic Design

UrbanForge is designed to bridge the gap between **urban planning**, **investment logic**, and **AI-powered design generation**. It starts with a clear MVP goal—supporting development decisions based on key financial objectives—while remaining modular and expandable to support advanced AI and BIM integration in the future.

### Key Strategic Goals:
- 🏗️ Empower non-designers to make informed land-use decisions
- 💰 Enable real estate teams to compare multiple schemes by ROI, valuation, and cash flow
- ⚙️ Serve as a backend engine for real estate platforms or urban simulators

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

| Layer        | Technology                             | Purpose                                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Three.js      | UI, form inputs, visual layout viewer        |
| Backend      | Node.js or FastAPI (Python)            | Business logic, financial calculations       |
| Database     | PostgreSQL + PostGIS                   | Land/project storage + geo queries           |
| AI Engine    | PyTorch / Scikit-Learn / Optimization  | (Later stage) generative and optimization AI |
| Deployment   | Vercel / Docker / Railway / Supabase   | Lightweight deploy options                   |

Architecture follows **MVP-first**, then gradually supports:
- Rule-based → heuristic → AI-assisted generation
- 2D → simplified 3D → BIM-compatible outputs

| 🚧 V1  | Configurable parameters + Multi-goal       | Goal selection → layout variants + comparative analysis         |
| 🧪 V2  | Data-driven suggestions                    | Add zoning logic, site constraints, market pricing              |
| 🔮 V3  | AI-assisted generation + 3D/BIM export     | Use AI to generate building blocks + export to IFC/Revit        |

## 🌱 Future Expansion

1. **AI Design Generator**  
   - Use ControlNet, LoRA, or Transformer-based layout generation  
   - Automatically suggest building massings or zoning configurations

2. **GIS & Real Market Data Integration**  
   - Fetch real land parcel data from municipal open data platforms  
   - Match real estate pricing and regulation layers to outputs

3. **Plugin for Developers & Municipalities**  
   - Create plugins for real estate analysis tools or city planning portals

4. **BIM & Game Engine Integration**  
   - Export models to IFC, Unity, Unreal for presentation or simulation

5. **Multi-user Collaboration Platform**  
   - Role-based design: developer, architect, investor, urban planner
